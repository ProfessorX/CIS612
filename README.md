## Introduction ##

We have to finish the writing and coding part. Right now I am working
on the ElGamal stuff. I suppose I can finish this writing stuff by the
end of Thursday.



## Reading ##
I have some more stuff to read. God bless PRC.

## Writing ##

## Programming ##
* Realization of RSA algorithm. Maybe in C, more likely in Python.
* Implementation of ElGamal cryptosystem. And maybe the digital
  signature scheme.
* Anything else will be updated......(If I do have the time.)
