# Information Security #
Life is never easy. Especially if this is your first time to...Well,
study abroad.

** No more excuses and get things done! My master Abraham!!! Or you
   shall be kicked off from this, CARE-FREE research institute.**



## Introduction ##
We have to finish the writing and coding part. Right now I am working
on the ElGamal stuff. I suppose I can finish this writing stuff by the
end of Thursday.



## Reading ##
I have some more stuff to read. God bless PRC.

## Writing ##

## Programming ##
    * Realization of RSA algorithm. Maybe in C, more likely in Python.
    * Implementation of ElGamal cryptosystem. And maybe the digital
    signature scheme.
    * Anything else will be updated......(If I do have the time.)

## TODO ##
    1. Finish reading the final few documents.
    2. Begin the programming of your part. (ElGamal cryptosystem)
    3. Begin the writing part of your literature review.

        1. Well, as a member of the research group, right now all I want
           is...A meal.
        2. Finish your writing part recently. I mean...Recently. (I am never
           born in Nepal, so...I do not know what life there is like.)
        3. Rest in peace. Yanan (Abraham) Xiao.

        General outline for my part. In writing we are happy.
        * Background. Discuss Diffie-Hellman key exchange. (New directions
        in Cryptography.)
        * Computational Diffie-Hellman problem.
        * Decision Diffie-Hellman problem.
        * Discrete logarithm problem.
        * ElGamal cryptosystem
        * Something more? Then possibly attacks.

        1. Life is hard. Indeed hard.
        2. I love my keyboard.
        3. Finish the Information Security write-up within the
           day. Moreover, start processing your data.

    20131201 Lab 21:00
        1. There are some subsections to accomplish.
           * Diffie-Hellman key exchange
           * The discrete logarithm problem
           * The ElGamal encryption scheme
           * Possible attacks. (for this part, we can have a lot to
             write.)
