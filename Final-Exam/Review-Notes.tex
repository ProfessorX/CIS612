\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CIA}, a modern definition. Confidentiality: prevent
  unauthorized reading of information. Integrity: detect unauthorized
  writing of information. Availability: data is available in a timely
  manner when needed. 
\item \textbf{Network Security}. Various protocols play a critical
  role, and cryptography matters a lot in protocol (especially network
  protocols) design and analysis.
\item \textbf{Kerckhoof's Principle}. The system is completely known
  to the attacker; only the key is secret; the crypto algorithms are
  not secret. 
\item \textbf{Confusion and Diffusion}. Confusion: obscuring the
  relationship between plaintext and ciphertext. Diffusion: spreading
  the plaintext statistics through the ciphertext. A little note: hash
  function can be viewed as \emph{one way cryptography}.
\item \textbf{Stream Cipher}. Both A5/1 and RC4 are examples of this
  symmetric cryptosystem. It generalized the idea of a one-time pad,
  except that we trade provably security with a relatively small (and
  manageable) key. The key is stretched into a long stream of bits,
  which is then used just like a one-time pad. 
\item \textbf{Block Cipher}. It's really just an ``electronic''
  version of a codebook, and employs both confusion and diffusion.

  %     \STATE~Life is a bitch.
  %     \IF{You are a bitch}
  %     \STATE~Do something never that silly.
  %     \ENDIF

  \begin{algorithm}
    \caption{RC4 Keystream Byte}
    \label{algo:rc4-keystream-byte}
    \begin{algorithmic}
      \STATE~$i=(i+1)\mod 256$
      \STATE~$j=(j+S[i]\mod 256)$
      \STATE~swap $(S[i], S[j])$
      \STATE~$t=(S[i]+S[j]\mod 256)$
      \STATE~$Keystream~ byte=S[t]$
    \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
\item \textbf{Feistel Cipher}. It's a general cipher design
  principle. $L_{i}=R_{i-1}$ and $R_{i}=L_{i-1}\oplus
  F(R_{i-1},K_{i})$.
\item \textbf{DES}. The security of this cryptosystem has much to do
  with \emph{S-box}. Steps: an initial permutation before round 1;
  halves are swapped after last round; a final permutation applied to
  $R_{16},L_{16}$. 
  \begin{algorithm}
    \caption{TEA Encryption}
    \label{algo:tea-encryption}
    \begin{algorithmic}
      \STATE~$(K[0],K[1],K[2],K[3])=128~bit~key$
      \STATE~$(L,R)=plaintext$ ($64-bit$ block)
      \STATE~$delta=0$x$9e3779b9$
      \STATE~$sum=0$
      \FOR{$i=1$ to $32$}
      \STATE~$sum=sum+delta$
      \STATE~$L=L+(((R\ll 4)\oplus K[0])\oplus (R+sum)\oplus ((R\gg
      5)\oplus K[1]))$
      \STATE~$R=L+(((L\ll 4)\oplus K[2])\oplus (L+sum)\oplus ((L\gg
      5)\oplus K[3]))$
      \STATE~next $i$
      \ENDFOR
      \STATE~$ciphertext=(L,R)$
    \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
\item \textbf{Block Cipher Modes}. ECB:\@ encrypt each block
  independently. CBC:\@ chain the blocks together. For this mode, a
  random initialization vector is required. CTR:\@ block cipher acts
  like stream one.  
\item \textbf{Data Integrity}. The encryption process does provide
  confidentiality, but no guarantee of integrity. 
  \begin{algorithm}
    \begin{algorithmic}
      \caption{Key generation for RSA public key encryption}
      \label{algo:keygen-for-rsa-encrypt}
      \ENSURE~Each entity creates an RSA public key and a
      corresponding private key. Each entity A should do the
      following:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Generate two large random and distinct primes $p$ and $q$,
        each roughly the same size.
      \item Compute $n=pq$ and $\phi=(p-1)(q-1)$.
      \item Select a random integer $e$, $1\leq e\leq\phi$, such that
        $\gcd(e,\phi)=1$. 
      \item Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the unique
        integer $d$, such that $ed\equiv 1\mod\phi$.
      \item A's public key is $(n,e)$, private key is $d$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
\item \textbf{RSA Validity Proof}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Since $ed\equiv 1\mod\phi$, there exists an integer $k$ such
    that $ed=1+k\phi$. 
  \item Now if $\gcd(m,p)=1$, then by Fermat's theorem, $m^{p-1}\equiv
    1\mod p$. 
  \item Raising both sides of this congruence to the power $k(q-1)$
    and then multiplying both sides by $m$ yields
    $m^{1+k(p-1)(q-1)}\equiv m\mod p$.
  \item On the other hand if $\gcd(m,p)=p$, then this last congruence
    is valid since each side is congruence to $0\mod p$. 
  \item Hence, in all cases, $m^{ed}\equiv m\mod p$. By the same
    argument, $m^{ed}\equiv m\mod q$. 
  \item Finally, since $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, it follows
    that $m^{ed}\equiv m\mod n$. And hence, $c^{d}\equiv
    {(m^{e})}^{d}\equiv m\mod n$.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cube Root attack} on RSA.\@ A simple but practical way to
  prevent is to pad message with random bits.
\item \textbf{Cryptographic Hash Function}. This function must provide
  the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Compression. For any size input $x$, the output length,
    i.e. $h(x)$ is small. Usually a fixed length is pre-defined.
  \item Efficiency. It must be easy to compute $h(x)$ for any input
    $x$. 
  \item One way. Given any value $y$, it's computationally infeasible
    to find a value $x$ such that $h(y)=x$.
  \item Weak Collision Resistance. Given $x$ and $h(x)$, it's
    infeasible to find any $y$, with $y\neq x$, such that
    $h(y)=h(x)$.
  \item Strong Collision resistance. It's (and should be so)
    infeasible to find any $x\neq y$ such that $h(x)=h(y)$.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Birthday Problem}. Strong one. How large much the $N$ be
  before the probability that someone shares the same birthday with
  me? Weak one. How many people must be in a room before the
  probability of at least two share the same birthday is larger than
  $0.5$?  
\item Yet another ``final exam''.
\end{itemize}
