\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CIA}, a modern definition. Confidentiality: prevent
  unauthorized reading of information. Integrity: detect unauthorized
  writing of information. Availability: data is available in a timely
  manner when needed. 
\item \textbf{Network Security}. Various protocols play a critical
  role, and cryptography matters a lot in protocol (especially network
  protocols) design and analysis.
\item \textbf{Kerckhoof's Principle}. The system is completely known
  to the attacker; only the key is secret; the crypto algorithms are
  not secret. 
\item \textbf{Confusion and Diffusion}. Confusion: obscuring the
  relationship between plaintext and ciphertext. Diffusion: spreading
  the plaintext statistics through the ciphertext. A little note: hash
  function can be viewed as \emph{one way cryptography}.
\item \textbf{Block Cipher}. It's really just an ``electronic''
  version of a codebook, and employs both confusion and diffusion.
